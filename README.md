# QSE (Quest Song exporter)
A Tool to zip Beat Saber songs from Quest (custom_level_SomeHash) to the right names.

# How-to
Connect your Quest to you PC. Then copy all folders from "sd card\BMBFData\CustomSongs" to any empty folder on your PC. After it has finished copying start QSE.bat. It asks you to put in a Directory where your songs folders are. You have to put in the folder you just copied them. It'll start zipping them right away. After it has finished it'll let you know how many Songs it zipped. 

It will also work for PC Songs.

# Known Issues
- Some Songs have a Space after their name. Then the zip will be named something like "iLLness LiLin .zip" but there's nothing to worry.
- It will not automatically detect Songs. It'll check every Folder.
- Exported Songs Counter may be wrong.
